Yellow is often abused by Red, but that never endangers their friendship. Although usually he obeys Red, he loses his mind in front of food. Yellow is bad with Red because he take all things that are for Red and Red always fights him. He changes color from yellow to brown and he grows green shades around his mouth when feeling extreme emotions. \nRed ‚Äì a mostly hot-tempered and greedy red-colored caterpillar. Arrogant and often seen abusing Yellow, Red usually ends up hurting himself instead. He usually shouts like Bruce Lee when afraid or angered.\n\n#New_Larva_2020  #Larva_Rewind #LarvaRewind\n#Larva_Rewind #larvatuba #larvacartoon #larva2020 \n#larva4k #Newlarva4K \n#RewindLarva , #animatedshortfilms, #animatedcartoonscharacters, #top10animation, #foodanimation, #funnyvideos, #comedy, #comedyvideos, #cartoonmovie, #funnyclips, #compilation, #animation, #cartoon, #pencilmate,  #funnycartoon, #splendidcartoon,  #cartoonseries, #newcartoon, #fun, #america\n#Funnycartoon2020 #LarvaMovie2020FullEpisodes #LarvaMovie2020\n#LarvaFull4K #larvaofficial #cartoonlarva\n#newcartoonmovie #newcartoon2020 #newcartoonlarva #newlarvacartoon\ncartoon for kids,cartoon,cartoons for kids,baby bus,baby songs,babybus,kids,animation,abc song,kids songs,funny,ryan toysreview,2020,oddbods,nursery rhymes,kids videos for kids\nlarva,larva cartoon,larva hd,larva season 4,larva episodes,larva 2020,larva song,larva tuba,larva full movie,larva funny,larva compilation,larva full episode,larva cartoon 2016,larva official,larva 2019,larva 2017,larva english,larva new york,larva 2017 movie,larva animation,new larva,lavra,larva 2016 full movie,larva island,larva netflix,larva rangers,larva english full episodes,\noddbods,cartoonz,sunny bunnies,tuba,ho·∫°t h√¨nh,larva 2020,cartoons for kids,lava,larva cartoon,ice,vida real,larva island,2020 cartoon,larva island full episodes,valentines day,real life,cartoons for children,in real life,larva tuba,larva season 4,·∫•u tr√πng tinh ngh·ªãch,larva full movie,lavra,larva 2020,funny cartoons for kids,valentines,larva rangers,youtube cartoons,love cartoon,larva official,childrens cartoons,animation movies full movies,larva collection 2020,larva cartoons best new collection 2020,larva hd,larva compilation 2020,ho·∫°t h√¨nh larva,larva ice,new larva,larva movie 2020 full episodes,larva netflix,larva 2020,larva new,en la vida real,larva baby,larva compilation,larva 2020 episodes,nana star,larva full compilation,red larva,larva 2020 full movie,funny larva,larva song,larvaa,larva funny,larva english,larva tv,au trung tinh nghich,larva episodes,baby larva,larva 2020,hoat hinh larva,yellow larva,larva full episode,larva full episodes in english,larva english full episodes,larva new york,larva 2020 movie,larva animation,larva cartoon 2020,larva girls,girls cartoons,·∫•u tr√πng tinh ngh·ªãch t·∫≠p phim si√™u h√†i p3,larva spooky ring,wellcom to larva island,funny larva compliation 2020",

He may seem cold-blooded and evil, but he actually wants to get close to others and become their friends. He has OCD and a complete neat freak! You may see him and his sidekick KongKong get up to no good, but he's a good soul really!\r\n\r\nFrankie is a bit of a dull slowpoke, Frankie's appetite sometimes turns him into a bit of a monster! He grows a four-leaf clover on top of his head which is lucky charm. He's one of the kindest members of the Spookiz gang, but his appetite sometimes puts him in a foul mood if he is not full up!\r\n\r\nKebi is a free-minded soul and isn't one to stick to rules and formality. He's constantly energetic and bubbly and loves to tease Cula as much as he can. It is a friendly rivalry though as they truly are best buddies!\r\n\r\nKongKong is Cula's sidekick KongKong is best described as weak to the strong and strong to the weak. He's very self conscious about his short height but by listening and trusting in Cula he feels safe and comforted.\r\n\r\nZizi shows gives off a stinking odour but she does not realise it. Body parts (mainly her head) often fall apart off her body, but are always easily placed back together on her. She has a secret crush on Cula and dreams of being with him always. She's incredibly shy around him and doesn't like anyone to know this.\r\n\r\n‚ñ∫ Visit our Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/spookizworld\r\n‚ñ∫ Visit Our Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/spookizworld\r\n‚ñ∫ Brought to you by Keyring Studios: http://www.keyringstudio.com\r\n\r\n#spookiz #spookizcartoon #spookizepisodes #kidscartoons #spookizmovie",

Yellow is often abused by Red, but that never endangers their friendship. Although usually he obeys Red, he loses his mind in front of food. Yellow is bad with Red because he take all things that are for Red and Red always fights him. He changes color from yellow to brown and he grows green shades around his mouth when feeling extreme emotions. \nRed ‚Äì a mostly hot-tempered and greedy red-colored caterpillar. Arrogant and often seen abusing Yellow, Red usually ends up hurting himself instead. He usually shouts like Bruce Lee when afraid or angered.\n\n#New_Larva_2020  #Larva_Rewind #LarvaRewind\n#Larva_Rewind #larvatuba #larvacartoon #larva2020 \n#larva4k #Newlarva4K \n#RewindLarva , #animatedshortfilms, #animatedcartoonscharacters, #top10animation, #foodanimation, #funnyvideos, #comedy, #comedyvideos, #cartoonmovie, #funnyclips, #compilation, #animation, #cartoon, #pencilmate,  #funnycartoon, #splendidcartoon,  #cartoonseries, #newcartoon, #fun, #america\n#Funnycartoon2020 #LarvaMovie2020FullEpisodes #LarvaMovie2020\n#LarvaFull4K #larvaofficial #cartoonlarva\n#newcartoonmovie #newcartoon2020 #newcartoonlarva #newlarvacartoon\ncartoon for kids,cartoon,cartoons for kids,baby bus,baby songs,babybus,kids,animation,abc song,kids songs,funny,ryan toysreview,2020,oddbods,nursery rhymes,kids videos for kids\nlarva,larva cartoon,larva hd,larva season 4,larva episodes,larva 2020,larva song,larva tuba,larva full movie,larva funny,larva compilation,larva full episode,larva cartoon 2016,larva official,larva 2019,larva 2017,larva english,larva new york,larva 2017 movie,larva animation,new larva,lavra,larva 2016 full movie,larva island,larva netflix,larva rangers,larva english full episodes,\noddbods,cartoonz,sunny bunnies,tuba,ho·∫°t h√¨nh,larva 2020,cartoons for kids,lava,larva cartoon,ice,vida real,larva island,2020 cartoon,larva island full episodes,valentines day,real life,cartoons for children,in real life,larva tuba,larva season 4,·∫•u tr√πng tinh ngh·ªãch,larva full movie,lavra,larva 2020,funny cartoons for kids,valentines,larva rangers,youtube cartoons,love cartoon,larva official,childrens cartoons,animation movies full movies,larva collection 2020,larva cartoons best new collection 2020,larva hd,larva compilation 2020,ho·∫°t h√¨nh larva,larva ice,new larva,larva movie 2020 full episodes,larva netflix,larva 2020,larva new,en la vida real,larva baby,larva compilation,larva 2020 episodes,nana star,larva full compilation,red larva,larva 2020 full movie,funny larva,larva song,larvaa,larva funny,larva english,larva tv,au trung tinh nghich,larva episodes,baby larva,larva 2020,hoat hinh larva,yellow larva,larva full episode,larva full episodes in english,larva english full episodes,larva new york,larva 2020 movie,larva animation,larva cartoon 2020,larva girls,girls cartoons,·∫•u tr√πng tinh ngh·ªãch t·∫≠p phim si√™u h√†i p3,larva spooky ring,wellcom to larva island,funny larva compliation 2020",

Yellow is often abused by Red, but that never endangers their friendship. Although usually he obeys Red, he loses his mind in front of food. Yellow is bad with Red because he take all things that are for Red and Red always fights him. He changes color from yellow to brown and he grows green shades around his mouth when feeling extreme emotions. \nRed ‚Äì a mostly hot-tempered and greedy red-colored caterpillar. Arrogant and often seen abusing Yellow, Red usually ends up hurting himself instead.
